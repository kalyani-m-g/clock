 Digital Clock
A simple digital clock built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM and updates every second.

 What I Learned
- How to use the `Date` object in JavaScript to fetch current time.
- Formatting time strings with leading zeros for consistent display.
- Updating the DOM dynamically using `innerText`.
- Basic CSS flexbox styling for centering content.

Favorite Feature
The **smooth time update** every second without flickering, and the clean, centered design with a dark theme.

Future Improvements
- Add a toggle button for switching between **12-hour and 24-hour formats**.
- Show the current **date** below the clock.
- Add **animations** for digit changes.
- Make it responsive for mobile view with adaptive font sizes.
